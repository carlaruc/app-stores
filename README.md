# App Store

During this project we take on the role of a data analyst working for a company that builds free Android and iOS apps. Since the apps are free, the revenue comes from in-app ads meaning that the more users that see and engage with the ads the better. The goal is to identify what type of apps are more likely to attract more users and generate more revenue.
